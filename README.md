The data shows the CitiBikes are mainly used for commuters. When we look at the Popular Starting/Ending Locations, we can observe they match the main Public transportation hubs in NYC: Grand Central, 42nd St, NJ Ferry transit etc. Also, when we observe the using time, we can deduct the bicycles are mostly used during commute times. Last but not least, the users are mainly subscribers, which means daily users.

We can observe that the number of subscribers as dropped between 2019 and 2020 as well as the use of the Citibikes, especially during the confinement.
